# Nerds Notes - The Collection

## Description

Created a study guide to refer to during coding bootcamp. Contains notes/cheats for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

Built this project to have information easily accesible during class. Also cleaned up my bookmark bar a bit by adding needed links to this project.

Everything you see here I didn't know until prior to this bootcamp.
